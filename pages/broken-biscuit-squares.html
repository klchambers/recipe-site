     <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
     <ul>
        <li>250g unsalted butter, softened, plus extra for the tin</li>
        <li>100g caster sugar</li>
        <li>150g light soft brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tsp almond extract</li>
        <li>1 orange, zested</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>250g plain flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>2 tbsp milk</li>
     </ul>
    
     <strong>For the white chocolate ganache:</strong>
     <ul>
        <li>300g white chocolate, finely chopped</li>
        <li>150ml double cream</li>
     </ul>

     <strong>For the broken biscuits:</strong>
     <ul>
        <li>30g jammy ring biscuits</li>
        <li>30g chocolate sandwich biscuits</li>
        <li>30g custard sandwich biscuits</li>
     </ul>

     <em>Method:</em>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 5. Butter and line a 30 x 20cm tin. 
            Put the butter and sugars in a mixing bowl and beat using an electric whisk until light and fluffy. 
            Add the vanilla and almond extracts and orange zest. Mix to combine.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the eggs one by one. After each egg, make sure to whisk fast to avoid any splitting. 
            Add the flour and baking powder and whisk for 2 mins until you have smooth batter. Fold in the milk. 
            Spoon the mixture into the prepared tin and bake on the middle shelf for 25-30 mins until a skewer 
            inserted into the middle comes out clean. Leave the cake to cool in the tin for 10 mins, 
            then transfer to a cooling rack until cooled completely.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, make the ganache. Put the chopped white chocolate in a large heatproof bowl. Bring the cream to a boil in a small saucepan, 
            then immediately pour it over the chocolate. Leave for 1 min to melt. Whisk the cream and melted chocolate until you have a smooth, 
            ganache mixture. Set aside – it’ll thicken as it cools.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread the ganache on top of the cooled sponge in an even layer using a palette knife. Roughly break up the biscuits, then scatter them evenly over the cake. Cut into 12 squares.
        </li>
    </ol>
