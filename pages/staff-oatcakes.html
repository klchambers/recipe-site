<h2>Staffordshire Oatcakes</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Delicious light pancakes</em> made with oats and yeast, the traditional 
        filling would be practically any combination of ingredients from an ‘all-day breakfast’
        but anything goes these days.
        <p>Chicken curry, chilli con carne, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon 
        and coronation chicken are now quite the norm amongst the oatcake avant-garde,
        as well as golden syrup, honey, jam and cream.</p>

     <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
     <ul>
        <li>150g fine oatmeal</li>
        <li>150g wholemeal flour</li>
        <li>300ml milk</li>
        <li>300ml water</li>
        <li>7g sachet quick-rising yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>salt</li>
     </ul>

     <em>Method:</em>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the milk and water in a saucepan and warm gently on the hob. 
            This is just to create good conditions for the yeast when 
            the batter is mixed so, as always, keep it below 30°C.</li>
        <p></p>
            <li>
            Add all of the dry ingredients to a bowl and mix together before starting to 
            whisk in all of the warm milk and water. I was looking to get a reasonably thin batter 
            and 600ml did the trick on this occasion. Of course, add less or more milk and water as the 
            situation dictates. Once the batter is mixed, cover with plastic wrap and leave in a warm room 
            for about an hour, allowing the yeast to make the batter nice and bubbly.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
            When it’s ready, give the batter a gentle stir,
             smear a little butter or oil on a hot, non-stick skillet and add 
             enough of the batter to thinly coat the bottom. Cook on one side until golden (about 3 minutes) 
             and gently flip over and cook the other side for another couple of minutes.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <em>Note:</em>
        <li>
            As oatcakes contain less flour, and wholemeal flour at that, 
            they contain less gluten and will be more prone to tear. I’m guessing this is why people 
            bulk them up with plain flour, but it’s by no means a problem, it just means a gentler hand is required. 
            No vigorous skillet-shaking.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>This batter will yield about 6 large oatcakes. Don’t just stick to savoury fillings, 
            either. Fruit, berries, crème fraîche, syrup, ice cream are all brilliant with these pancakes.</li>
    </ol>
